Feature Enhancement: Tagging and Search Functionality
In Part 3 AO3, we've integrated tagging and search features into our group's website's primary function - a forum where users can share their thoughts and content.

Tagging Feature:
When users make a post, they have the option to add tags from a predefined selection that best suits the content of their post. Alternatively, if none of the predefined tags match the content, users can select "Customize Tag". This action reveals a hidden text field where users can input a custom tag that fits their content.

Filtering by Tags:
For other users navigating the main page, we've added a "Filter" button beneath "All Posts". When clicked, a selection of tags appears, allowing users to filter posts by selecting specific tags. After selecting the desired tag(s), users can apply the filter, and only posts containing the selected tag(s) will appear on the main page.

Search Functionality:
In addition to filtering by tags, users can utilize the search functionality by entering a keyword they wish to search for. After inputting the keyword, users can click the "Search" button. This action filters posts based on whether their title, content, or tag contains the given keyword, displaying relevant posts on the main page.
